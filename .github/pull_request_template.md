  - [x] Application is divided to logical modules / layers. Like working with api it's separate module, as well as working with UI rendering, or working with an application state, etc. Better discuss architecture with a mentor before implementing. (40/40)
  - [x] All the HTML-content is generated by JavaScript (body contains only one tag script inside). (15/30) 
  - [ ] Application is SPA.(0/20)
  - [x] Webpack or another bundler should be used. There should be one HTML-file, JS-file, and one CSS-file (or it can be embedded right in the HTML-file). (20/20)
