This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

Compiles the application for production deployment. It optimizes the app for the best performance.

### Start the application in production mode

```bash
npm run start
```

Starts the server in production mode. Must be used after building the app.

### Lint the project files

```bash
npm run lint
```

Runs ESLint to find and fix problems in your JavaScript and TypeScript files within the app/ directory.

### Format the project files

```bash
npm run format
```

Runs Prettier to format your code, targeting files in the app/ directory including JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and Markdown.

### Run Tests
